            Bengaluru , known as Indiaâ€™s Silicon Valley faced a significant water crisis in 2018. 
            Rapid urbanisation ,over-extraction of ground water ,and the depletion of its lake led 
            to severe water shortages .The city,which once had over a thousands lakes , saw many of
             them dry up or get polluted ,exacerbating the water scarcity problem.    (Bengaluru water crisis)
