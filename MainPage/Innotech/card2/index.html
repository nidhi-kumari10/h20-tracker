            On June 19,2019 ,Chennai city officially declared that “DAY ZERO”,or the day when almost 
            no water is left ,had been reached as all the four main resorviors supplying water to the 
            city had run dry. Two years of deficient rainfall ,particularly in the late 2017 and throughout 
            much of 2018 has led to the crisis      (Chennai water crises).
